to run this code, first install these packages using pip:

numpy, pandas, itertools, matplotlib, scipy, statistics

if necessary, install any others requested by the debugger.

then, run main.py (i recommend to be run at idle for python)

at the end of the code, there are some systems used as examples, with training parameters already set. it will train, forecast and plot the results.

for example, to run the lorenz system, delete the ''' of the lines 404 and 408, compile and then run. the details of the calculations are throughout the code.
